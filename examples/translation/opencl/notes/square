Think about while parsing:
  Use /n, but remove after placing
  Use / outside of "", but remove after placing
ToDo:
  Something about those __types
  Somehow use the new types and make $ civl equivalents
  Figure out where to call it
  Deal with the methods that gather data from it
    possibly make other methods
  get_global_id(0);
Done:
  Some basic code
