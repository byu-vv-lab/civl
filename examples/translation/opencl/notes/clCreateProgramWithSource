ToDo:
  For the kernel source currently, CIVL can't take a string and interpret  it into a function.
  For now, convert to a regular method
    Get those types for kernel, __global, etc. somehow
      How to make it so that we can go __global string [name]?
    How to convert to regular method?
    How to pass in a method as parameter in c?
  
  
  Two paths:
    Turn into completely regular methods right now
      Have to deal with those types later
    Make structs/typedefs for them of kernel
      What to do about __global and __local? (also applies to the one above)
Done:
