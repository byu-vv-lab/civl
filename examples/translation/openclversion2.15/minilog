Done:
  make the args struct
  implement clCreateKernel
  Array with flags in, tells the program what variables are malloc'd or not so they don't try to free the same space
  
  
ToDo:

  
ToDo: Long term:
  Possible implementation of clGetKernelWorkGroupInfo, if an example that needs it is used
  Possible implementation of clGetDeviceInfo
  Re-arrange code so that the group designation is actually possible

Problems:
  This example does not neatly into work already done.
  No memset(); 
  No strcmp();
  Program crash when using array index of kernel
  Bug in memory leak detection
  Forgot to notice that there need to be multiple args
