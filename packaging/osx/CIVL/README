CIVL pre-compiled binary distribution for Mac OS X 64-bit intel.

The directory containing this file should be called CIVL.
This directory should contain the following:

 - README : this file
 - bin : containing one executable sh script called "civl"
 - lib : containing a version of civl.jar and native solver libraries
         such as those for cvc3
 - doc : containing some documentation about CIVL.

Installation instructions:
  1. Move folder CIVL into the /Applications folder
  2. Put the civl script in your path however you like to put things
     into your path.   Either move it to a directory in your path,
     or create a symlink to it, or edit your .profiles or equivalent
     to put it in your path.

Now you should be able to run CIVL from the command line by 
typing "civl <filename>".
