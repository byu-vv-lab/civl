 <p>Welcome to CIVL, the Concurrency Intermediate Verification Language tool. 
 CIVL is a Java project for verifying concurrent programs written in CIVL-C, 
 which is a C dialect with extensions to concurrent language constructs. 
 The CIVL project uses ABC, SARL and GMC.
 The CIVL tool can be used to perform a number of tasks, including the following:
 <ol>
 <li>preprocess or pass a CIVL-C program;</i>
 <li>verify a CIVL-C program;</li>
 <li>run a CIVL-C program;</li>
 <li>replay traces for a program.</li>
 </ol>

	In addition, it provides a framework for developing your own libraries
	or transformations on ASTs of  various language extensions and libraries.
	</p>

	There is a simple command-line interface for CIVL (see {@link
	edu.udel.cis.vsl.civl.CIVL CIVL}), but most users will want to use CIVL
	through its API. To use the API, it is helpful to have some
	understanding of the modular structure of CIVL. The CIVL source code is
	decomposed into modules, each with a well-defined interface and set of
	responsibilities. Some of these modules are decomposed further into
	sub-modules. The top-level modules are:
	<ol>

		<li><strong>util</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>responsibilities: simple general-purpose utility classes
					that do not use other parts of CIVL</li>
				<li>uses: nothing</li>
				<li>interface: {@link edu.udel.cis.vsl.civl.util.IF}</li>
				<li>entry point: none</li>
			</ol></li>

	</ol>
